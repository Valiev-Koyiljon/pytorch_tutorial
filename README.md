# Pytorch Zero to GANs Tutorial Notebooks

## Overview
This repository contains my personal notebooks for the course "Pytorch Zero to GANs". The course, offered by [Jovian](https://jovian.com) (formerly known as Jovian.ml), is an excellent introduction to deep learning and generative adversarial networks using the Pytorch framework.

## Course Description
"Pytorch Zero to GANs" is a practical, hands-on approach to learning Pytorch, one of the leading frameworks for deep learning. The course covers everything from the basics of Pytorch to the intricacies of implementing generative adversarial networks (GANs). By the end of the course, students have a thorough understanding of deep learning concepts and how to implement them using Pytorch.

## Notebooks Content
Here is a breakdown of the notebooks included in this repository:

1. **Introduction to Pytorch**
   - Basics of Pytorch
   - Tensors and Operations
2. **Linear Regression and Logistic Regression**
   - Implementing linear regression from scratch
   - Implementing logistic regression for classification
3. **Feedforward Neural Networks**
   - Building neural networks for image classification
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks**
   - Understanding and implementing CNNs
5. **Generative Adversarial Networks**
   - Building a basic GAN model from scratch

## Installation and Usage
To run these notebooks, you need to install Pytorch and other dependencies. Here's how you can set up your environment:

```bash
